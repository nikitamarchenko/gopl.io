ExerciseÂ 9.1: Add a function Withdraw(amount int) bool to the gopl.io/ch9/bank1
program. The result should indicate whether the transaction succeeded or failed
due to insufficient funds. The message sent to the monitor goroutine must
contain both the amount to withdraw and a new channel over which the monitor
goroutine can send the boolean result back to Withdraw.
